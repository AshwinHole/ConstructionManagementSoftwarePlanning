# Construction Site Management System

A comprehensive digital solution for modernizing construction industry management through an innovative mobile application.

## Overview

This project addresses critical inefficiencies in Indian construction sites by introducing a digital platform that transforms traditional verbal communication and paper-based record-keeping into a streamlined, organized system. The application serves as a central hub for all stakeholders involved in construction projects, including builders, architects, engineers, contractors, and project managers.

## Key Features
